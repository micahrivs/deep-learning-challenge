## Alphabet Soup Funding Predictor
Welcome to the Alphabet Soup Funding Predictor project! In this repository, we will develop a machine learning model to predict the success of organizations that receive funding from Alphabet Soup. The goal is to create a binary classifier that can determine whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Background
Alphabet Soup is a nonprofit foundation that aims to make informed decisions when selecting organizations for funding. To achieve this, we will leverage the power of machine learning and neural networks to build a predictive model. The provided dataset contains information about over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding from Alphabet Soup. Each organization is described by several key features, such as:

- EIN and NAME: Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
- USE_CASE: Intended use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION: Organization type
- STATUS: Active status of the organization
- INCOME_AMT: Income classification of the organization
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for the funding application
- ASK_AMT: Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL: Binary target variable indicating whether the funding was used effectively

## Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust binary classifier that can accurately predict whether an organization's funding will be used effectively (IS_SUCCESSFUL). To achieve this goal, we will follow these steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables as needed.
- Feature Selection: Analyze and select the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction task.
- Model Development: Build and train a machine learning model using neural networks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model for future use in predicting funding success.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset files in CSV format.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
models/: Saved model artifacts and weights.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model construction, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages for easy setup.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Summary
 I discovered that the common assumption that increasing the number of layers and epochs leads to higher accuracy rates is not always valid. Through careful experimentation and analysis, I found that there exists a point of diminishing returns where excessive layers and epochs can actually hinder accuracy. This highlights the importance of a balanced approach to model complexity and training duration, taking into consideration factors like dataset size, architecture design, and regularization techniques. This new perspective challenges the conventional belief and emphasizes the need for a more strategic and nuanced approach to optimizing neural network accuracy.
